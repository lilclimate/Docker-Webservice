# Name
lua-resty-test is Ngx_lua test frame based on Openresty


#Description
This Lua library is a test frame for test your ngx_lua source or other server(tcp or udp):

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

Note that at least ngx_lua 0.5.14 or ngx_openresty 1.2.1.14 is required.

#Synopsis


```nginx
 # you do not need the following line if you are using
    # the ngx_openresty bundle:
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-redis/lib/?.lua;;";

    # A lua_shared_dict named cache_ngx is required by test:bench_run
    lua_shared_dict cache_ngx 100k;

    server {

        listen 8080;

        server_name 127.0.0.1;

        error_log /path/to/error.log;

        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                	local iresty_test    = require "resty.iresty_test"
					local tb = iresty_test.new({unit_name="example"})


					function tb:init(  )
					    self:log("init complete")
					end

					function tb:test_00001(  )
					    error("invalid input")
					end

					function tb:atest_00002()
					    self:log("never be called")
					end

					function tb:test_00003(  )
					   self:log("ok")
					end

					-- units test
					tb:run()
            ';
        }
    }
```

Run test case:

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/test"
```

The output result:

```shell
0.000  [example] unit test start
0.000  [example] init complete
0.000    \_[test_00001] fail ...de/nginx/main_server/test_case_lua/unit/test_example.lua:9: invalid input
0.000    \_[test_00003] ↓ ok
0.000    \_[test_00003] PASS
0.000  [example] unit test complete
```
